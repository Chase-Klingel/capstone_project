#AudioVisual

There are two user types on AudioVisual. The first user type is a Vimeo producer and the second user type is a SoundCloud artist. The goal of AudioVisual is to connect the two users in order to create richer content.

When a Vimeo user signs up, I import all of their videos from Vimeo (both public and private). They are then prompted to select a mood for each video and whether that video needs music. Only the videos that they select as 'needing music' will show up on AudioVisual. The idea here is to protect their privacy. Once the Vimeo user has set up their profile, they can view a music feed, add songs to their music queue, and enter an editing room where they can test out the music in their queue with any of their Vimeo videos that they allow on AudioVisual. On the other side, when a SoundCloud user signs up, I import all of their music. They are then prompted to select a mood for each song and only the songs they select a mood for will be shown on AudioVisual. They can then view a video feed, add videos to their video queue, and enter an editing room where they can test whether their music would work nicely with a specific video.
